					<h3>B2C</h3>
					<hr>
					The term <b>business-to-consumer (B2C)</b> refers to the process of selling products and services
					directly
					between a business and consumers who are the end-users of its products or services.

					<h3>Difference Between B2C and B2B?</h3>

					<br>
					<table style="border: 1px solid black;">
						<tr>
							<th>B2B</th>
							<th>B2C</th>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>
								B2B E-Commerce is an online business model that facilitates online sales transactions
								between two businesses
							</td>
							<td>
								B2C E-Commerce refers to the process of selling to individual customers directly.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>
								An online retailer that sells office furniture is a B2B business because its primary
								target market is other businesses. B2B eCommerce also facilitates transactions between
								wholesalers and retailers or manufacturers and wholesalers and is typically a more
								complex process.

							</td>
							<td>
								B2C transaction would be someone buying a pair of shoes online or booking a pet hotel
								for a dog. It is likely the model that most people are familiar with.
							</td>
						</tr>
					</table>

					<br>
					Some companies operate as both B2B and B2C businesses. For instance, an events management company
					may offer wedding organization services, but may also provide conference management services to
					other businesses.

					<p>
					<ul style="font-size: 0.8em">
						<li><b>Global Reach</b>
							<br>
							The number one benefit of B2C E-Commerce is the global reach it has. Even small businesses
							operating out of homes can sell to customers on the other side of the world. This
							availability
							to sell to anyone anywhere makes sure success is inevitable.
						</li>
						<br>
						<li>
							<B> More Data to Profile Customers</B>
							<br>
							When you move your business online you open the door to more information about your
							customers
							and more ways to target them directly. Using analytics tools like Google Analytics you can
							discover demographic information about your consumers as well as psychographic information
							like
							consumer interests and values. This information can help you create a persona of your
							consumers
							that will inform how you talk to them through your website and any marketing material.
