The typical PowerPoint presentation isn't very interesting. Walls of text or bullet points, with few visuals - it's no wonder audiences find it hard to pay attention. Simple presentation on slides are not impressive at all. You can make it impressive by tweaking things on powerpoint or you can just use reveal.js.
I choose the reveal js option and this is a E-mareting ppt made with reveal js.
