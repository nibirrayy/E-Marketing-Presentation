							platform. Customers can click on specific products within a post linkingdirectly to a
							product
							page ‚Äî all without leaving the social media channel.Compared with the traditional eCommerce
							purchase path, social commerce shortens thebuyer‚Äôs journey. They‚Äôre able to seamlessly
							research,

							websites.And, when customers are in lower stages of the funnel, it‚Äôs a much more
							streamlinedprocess. Especially with the recent introduction of chatbot checkouts, and

							paymentsand delivery details. Social commerce removes the potential for confusion, and
