					<ul>
						<li><b>Artificial intelligence -</b> AI marketing uses artificial intelligence technologies to
							makeautomated decisions based on data collection, data analysis, and additional observations
							ofaudience or economic trends that may impact marketing efforts. AI is often used
							in marketing efforts where speed is essential. AI tools use data and customer profiles to
							learn how to best communicate with customers, then serve them tailored messages at the
							righttime without
							intervention from marketing team members, ensuring maximum efficiency. For many of today‚Äôs
							marketers, AI is used to augment marketing teams or to perform moretactical tasks that
							require
							less human nuance
						</li>
						<br>
						<li> Chat-bot and conversational marketing - conversational marketing is used
							to describe ‚Äúafeedback-oriented approach to marketing used by companies to drive engagement,
							developcustomer loyalty, grow the customer base, and, ultimately, grow revenue.
							Conversationalmarketing is based on the common sense idea of listening to your customer and
							potentialcustomer‚Äôs needs.‚Äù One of the most common way the companies are using
							conversationalmarketing is by the use of chat-bots. Chat-bots are used in various ways
							including customerservice.

					<ul>
						<li> Personalization - Personalized marketing is the implementation of a strategy
							by whichcompanies deliver individualized content to recipients through data collection,
							analysis, andthe use of automation technology. The goal of personalized marketing is to
							truly
							engagecustomers or prospective customers by communicating with each as an individual.
							Thereare
							numerous advantages of personalized marketing, for both businesses and consumers.These
							benefits
							include Improved customer experience, Increased brand loyalty etc.
						</li>

						<br>
						<li>
							Social Commerce &
							Shoppable
							Posts - Social channels are turning more and more intomini search engines of their own.
							According to Facebook data, 70% of shoppers look to socialmedia platforms (specifically
							Instagram) for product discovery. Customers are no longerusing these channels solely for
							entertainment purposes; they‚Äôre now using them to informtheir purchasing decisions.Social
							commerce differs from social media marketing, where your goal is often to drivereferral
							traffic
							from social media to your website or online store. With social commerceyou‚Äôre not
							redirecting
							users to your online store, instead giving them the ability to checkoutdirectly within the
							platform. Customers can click on specific products within a post linkingdirectly to a
							product
							page ‚Äî all without leaving the social media channel.Compared with the traditional eCommerce
							purchase path, social commerce shortens thebuyer‚Äôs journey. They‚Äôre able to seamlessly
							research,
							compare, and purchase a product inone channel, rather than needing to refer to several
							websites.And, when customers are in lower stages of the funnel, it‚Äôs a much more
							streamlinedprocess. Especially with the recent introduction of chatbot checkouts, and
							autofill
							paymentsand delivery details. Social commerce removes the potential for confusion, and
							cartabandonment and bounce. Simply put, there are fewer actions needed to complete apurchase
							‚Äî a
							key success factor for any eCommerce store.</li>
